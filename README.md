# vuln-payload-tester
A Python script designed to test web applications for vulnerabilities by sending various payloads to identify potential Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) vulnerabilities. The tool allows you to input base URLs and paths, then posts crafted payloads to evaluate the server's response and highlight potential weaknesses.


# vuln-payload-tester

**vuln-payload-tester** is a Python-based tool designed to help security researchers and developers identify Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) vulnerabilities in web applications. The tool works by sending crafted payloads to the server and analyzing the responses to detect possible code execution or data leaks caused by improperly handled user inputs in templates.

## Overview

Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) occurs when an attacker can inject malicious code into the server-side template engine, leading to remote code execution or data leakage. SSTI vulnerabilities can be exploited in many popular web frameworks that use templating engines, such as Jinja2, Twig, and Velocity.

The **vuln-payload-tester** automates the process of testing for SSTI vulnerabilities by posting various payloads to specified paths on a target web application and analyzing the responses.

## How It Works

1. The tool prompts you to enter a **BASE_URL** for the web application you want to test.
2. You can choose to either manually input **paths** or load them from a file.
3. The tool sends various SSTI payloads to each specified path.
4. If the server responds with a successful execution of the payload (e.g., returning unexpected results or errors), it indicates a potential vulnerability.
5. The tool prints the results and highlights any paths where vulnerabilities may exist.

## Installation

To install and run **vuln-payload-tester**, make sure you have Python 3.x installed and then install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install requests colorama


## Usage
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/vuln-payload-tester.git
cd vuln-payload-tester
Run the script:

bash
Copy code
python3 vuln_payload_tester.py
Follow the prompts to enter the BASE_URL and PATHS (either manually or from a file).

The tool will then test each path with various payloads and report back any responses.

@@ SSTI Vulnerabilities
SSTI vulnerabilities are a critical web security issue where an attacker is able to inject and execute arbitrary code in the template engine. Some common consequences of SSTI include:

Remote Code Execution: The attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server.

Data Leakage: Sensitive data may be exposed if the template engine is not securely configured.

Privilege Escalation: In some cases, SSTI vulnerabilities can lead to privilege escalation if the injected code allows the attacker to interact with backend systems.

## How SSTI Exploits Work
An attacker can exploit an SSTI vulnerability by injecting specially crafted payloads that the template engine processes and executes. These payloads might involve mathematical operations, string manipulations, or even complex expressions that invoke dangerous functions on the server.

For example:

{{ 7 * 7 }}: Basic mathematical expression.

{{ 7 * '7' }}: Exploit type that might cause an error or unexpected behavior.

a{*coment*}b}: A malformed comment that could potentially break the template rendering process.

${"z".join("ab")}: Payload designed to trigger functions or methods on the backend server.

Common Template Engines Affected by SSTI
Some of the most widely used template engines that are susceptible to SSTI include:

Jinja2 (Python)

Twig (PHP)

Velocity (Java)

Freemarker (Java)
