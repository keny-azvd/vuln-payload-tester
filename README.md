# vuln-payload-tester
A Python script designed to test web applications for vulnerabilities by sending various payloads to identify potential Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) vulnerabilities. The tool allows you to input base URLs and paths, then posts crafted payloads to evaluate the server's response and highlight potential weaknesses.
